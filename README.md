# Error-Handling-Solidity

Solidity uses state-reverting exceptions to handle errors. Such an exception undoes all changes made to the state in the current call and all its sub-calls and reports the error to the caller. Errors can occur at compile time or runtime. Methods used for error handling in solidity are require, assert, revert.
